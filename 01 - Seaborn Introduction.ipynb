    "\\item Seaborn’s goals are similar to those of R’s ggplot, but it takes a different approach with an imperative and object-oriented style that tries to make it straightforward to construct sophisticated plots. If matplotlib \\textit{“tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible”}, seaborn aims to make a well-defined set of hard things easy too.\n",

In the latter case, the plot is drawn using a Grid object that links the structure of the figure to the structure of the dataset in an abstract way.\n",
