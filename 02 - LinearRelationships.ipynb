    "Many datasets contain multiple quantitative variables, and the goal of an analysis is often to relate those variables to each other. \n",
    "* We previously discussed functions that can accomplish this by showing the joint distribution of two variables. It can be very helpful, though, to use statistical models to estimate a simple relationship between two noisy sets of observations. \n",
    "* The functions discussed in this chapter will do so through the common framework of linear regression.\n",

    "* In the spirit of Tukey, the regression plots in seaborn are primarily intended to add a visual guide that helps to emphasize patterns in a dataset during exploratory data analyses. \n",
    "* That is to say that seaborn is not itself a package for statistical analysis. To obtain quantitative measures related to the fit of regression models, you should use statsmodels. \n",
    "* The goal of seaborn, however, is to make exploring a dataset through visualization quick and easy, as doing so is just as (if not more) important than exploring a dataset through tables of statistics.\n"
